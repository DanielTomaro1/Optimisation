# Optimisation
Contains various optimisation problems including an analysis on Covid 19 data from John Hopkins University using optimisation techniques

Abstract
This study investigates COVID-19 trends in Victoria and South Australia using exponential and logistic growth models. While exponential fits provide insights at specific points, logistic models, supported by Triambak (2021), better capture growth phases. Initial mitigation slowed the virus but led to surges post-restrictions. Yearly analysis reveals Victoria's decreasing case rate and South Australia's dynamic growth aligned with public health changes, informing healthcare planning.
Introduction
This project aims to comprehensively analyse the trends of COVID-19 positive test results in Victoria and South Australia, inspired by Cook’s (2020) work on modelling COVID-19 transmission through population groups and Esragh’s (2020) study of transmission control measures reducing the spread of the disease by up to 90% in some Australian states. Further, Chang (2020) highlighted the potential consequences of lifting mitigation measures during the pandemic's peak, warning of the risk of continued exponential growth.
The primary objectives of this project are to:
1.	Examine the applicability of exponential and logistic growth models 
2.	Identify and interpret key parameters 
3.	Assess the impact of public health interventions 
4.	Provide data-driven recommendations 
The motivation for pursuing this project lies in the critical need for accurate and reliable data analysis to inform public health decisions by leveraging advanced modelling techniques.
